This pathway consists of:
   * Three workshops on the foundations of statistics including (1) Research Essentials; (2) Experimental Design and (3) Power and Sample Size.
   * The material is organised around Statistical Workflows, applicable in any software, giving practical step-by-step instructions on how to do the analysis, including assumption testing, model interpretation, and presentation of results.


## Research Essentials 
In this workshop we will give you a systematic workflow to apply to any research data analysis to make your quantitative work comprehensive, efficient, and more suitable for top-tier journals. We introduce you to the resources available from both the Sydney Informatics Hub and across the University that will support you in proceeding from hypothesis generation all the way through to publication. Our research workflow consists of a series of defined steps that will assist you in thinking about your data and preparing it for statistical analysis. Data analysis concepts will be covered in detail, including how experimental design fits into hypothesis generation and your final publication; and how to manage your analysis data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – an essential and often-overlooked stage of data analysis for determining the appropriate statistical methods to apply in your research. We will show you some of the more advanced statistical analysis methods to give you an idea of what is possible. Note that this workshop does not require knowledge of, or use of specific statistical software. The analysis methods may be performed using a range of university-supported software options.

## Experimental Design 
In this workshop we focus on the key aspects of experimental design that researchers and students may need to apply in their research. Higher degree research students and researchers engaging in new research are especially invited to attend. During the workshop there will be the opportunity to discuss your own research question and associated experimental design. The workshop will include the topics of (1) your research question, (2) experimental validity, (3) randomisation and bias, (4) blinding and bias, (5) blocking and confounding, (6) fixed and random effects, (7) replication and experimental units. No pre-requisite knowledge of statistical methods is required.

## Power and Sample Size 
In this workshop we will show you how power and sample size calculations will help you to determine the number of necessary subjects to include in your study, for completion of ethics and grant requirements, and ensure that you have thoroughly thought about your study design. This workshop covers the theory and concepts of power analysis and includes worked examples using G\*Power software. You will follow the examples on your own laptop PC or Mac. It is essential you have G\*Power pre-installed on your machine prior to the workshop. Download software from the G*Power website [here](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html). It is free, and available for both Windows and MacOS.
