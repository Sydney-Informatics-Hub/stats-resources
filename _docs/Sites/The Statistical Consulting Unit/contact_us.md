The consultation service and workshops are free for University of Sydney researchers and HDR students. All university staff involved in research, and all students undertaking a degree with at least a 50% research component are eligible for a statistical consulting session with us. If this is you, you might be wondering when to engage with us and how our consults work, [click here](what-to-expect) for more information. Projects will also be undertaken at subsidised rates.
