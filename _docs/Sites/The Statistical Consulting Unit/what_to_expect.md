Our approach to helping you during a consult dovetails with the workflows that we have developed as an educational resource. We have a ‘general research workflow’ which outlines the typical phases in any quantitative research project, and ‘statistical workflows’ which outline the practical steps we recommend when using various statistical methods. We describe and explore our workflows in depth during our training workshops, which are open to everyone that is eligible for a consult.

We welcome consults from researchers and research students from across the university, at any stage of the general research workflow. Where possible we encourage you to engage with us prior to data collection so that we can aid you in optimising your study design. There is no minimum or maximum level of expected statistical knowledge required to have a consult with us. In fact, we help researchers with any current level of statistical knowledge to improve their statistical literacy. We do this by offering you tailored advice for applying statistical methods and directing you to appropriate learning resources, rather than doing analysis work for you. 
Most initial consults start with you providing a description of the background to your research, and your current research questions. This allows us to gain a working understanding of your project so that we can offer appropriate advice and support. Our consults are usually one hour long. We recommend an in-person consultation wherever possible, as we find the consulting process more effective face to face. Where an in-person consultation is not practical for you, we can meet virtually using Zoom or other AV conferencing software.

We look forward to chatting with you about your research during a consult. We continue to learn so much from researchers about the fascinating research taking place at Sydney University. It is a privilege to learn about your research and to contribute to your work by providing you with statistical support.
