Statistical Consulting within the Sydney Informatics Hub offers a modular training programme made up of 1.5 hour workshops, each focusing on a single statistical method. Statistical Workflows giving practical step-by-step instructions applicable in any software are used and include experimental design, exploratory analysis, modelling, assumption testing, model interpretation and presentation of results. They are integrated into Training Pathways to give a holistic understanding of data analysis from a statistical perspective. You are encouraged to design a custom programme by mixing and matching workshops from different training pathways tailored to your research needs.

We continue to develop and improve our workshop offering through feedback and the needs we identify in our statistical consulting service. The workshop slides will be periodically updated, so we encourage you to regularly come back and download the most recent versions. The version number is shown next to the slides for download.

### Training Pathways
#### Foundational Statistics 

##### Research Essentials 
This workshop presents methods and concepts that will help you create world-changing research, worthy of top-tier journals. We introduce the concept of a research workflow, a series of defined steps that will assist you in thinking about your data and preparing it for statistical analysis. We introduce you to the resources available from both the Sydney Informatics Hub and across the University that will support you in proceeding from hypothesis generation all the way through to publication.

Data analysis concepts will be covered in detail, including how experimental design fits into hypothesis generation and your final publication; and how to manage your data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – an essential and often-overlooked stage of data analysis for determining the appropriate statistical methods to apply in your research. We will show you some of the more advanced statistical analysis methods to give you and idea of what is possible. Note that this workshop does not require knowledge of, or use of specific statistical software. The analysis methods may be performed using a range of commonly available software through the university.

##### Experimental Design 
This workshop focuses on the key aspects of experimental design that you may need to apply in your research. Topics include your experimental validity, randomisation and bias, blinding and bias, blocking and confounding, fixed and random effects, replication and experimental units. The workshop provides the opportunity to discuss your own research questions and associated experimental design. No pre-requisite knowledge of statistical methods is required. Higher degree research students engaging in new research are especially invited to attend.

##### Power and Sample Size 
These calculations will help you to determine the number of necessary subjects to include in your study, for completion of ethics and grant requirements, ensuring that you have thoroughly thought about your study design. This workshop covers the theory and concepts of power analysis and includes worked examples using GPower software. You will follow the examples on your own laptop PC or Mac. It is essential you have GPower pre-installed on your machine prior to the workshop.

#### Statistical Modelling 

##### Linear Models 1: Linear Regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA and Repeated Measures (a Simple Mixed Model) 
This workshop focuses on practical data analysis by presenting statistical workflows appliable in any software for 4 of the most common univariate analyses: linear regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and repeated measures (a simple mixed model) – all assuming a normal (gaussian) residual. These workflows can be easily extended to more complex models. The R code used to create output is also included.

##### Linear Models 2: Logistic and Poisson/Count Regression - An Introduction to Generalised Linear Models 
This workshop focuses on practical data analysis by presenting statistical workflows applicable in any software for 2 of the more common GLMMs: Logistic regression for binary data (using a Binomial distribution); and Poisson/count regression for count data (using a Poisson distribution). The GLM framework is also described in detail. The R code used to create output is also included.

##### Linear Models 3: Advanced Topics, Tips, and Tricks 
This workshop focuses specifically on reporting and interpretation estimated marginal means, confidence vs prediction intervals, applying and correcting for multiple comparisons, reporting variable 'importance', plus other reporting and interpretation tricks. As well as model parameterisation using the design matrix (interpreting categorical predictor parameters, dummy coding, effects coding) and more on mixed models (introducing the random slope).

##### Statistical Model Building 
This workshop examines and illustrates the key aspects and strategies of statistical model building to help you answer your research question, and avoid common pitfalls, erroneous models and incorrect conclusions. Appropriate statistical model building will help you to gain knowledge, as opposed to simply getting the best prediction (although that can be a goal as well). We will focus on concepts such as variable selection, multi-collinearity, interactions, selecting a model building strategy, comparing models and evaluating models. In general, these concepts are useful for any statistical model building. This workshop will provide generalised linear regression model examples. The focus will be on practical application of concepts, so mathematical descriptions will be kept to a minimum.

### Specialist Statistics 

##### Design and Analysis of Surveys 1 
This workshop is full of practical tips and guidelines on how to design, field, and analyse the more commonly used surveys. The initial focus is on how to setup and field a study. A variety of different questions and scales, including some unorthodox and novel ones, will be presented to give an appreciation of what is possible. Some of the topics covered will be line vs discrete scales, the effect of colour, optimal discrete/LIKERT scales, etc. Reporting and basic analysis of common question types will then be presented. Pros and cons of common analyses will be discussed (e.g. linear vs ordinal regression). The material is software agnostic and can be applied in any software.

##### Design and Analysis of Surveys 2: Advanced Topics 
This workshop builds on the information from Surveys 1. It explores topics including questionnaire validation and index creation using methods such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and Conjoint models such as Choice modelling. The material is software agnostic and can be applied in any software.

##### Multivariate Statistical Analysis 1: Dimension Reduction 
In multivariate statistics we simultaneously model and estimate variability in more than one variable often in order to examine the relationship between variables. This workshop examines the key aspects of moving from univariate to multivariate analysis, and the situations where multivariate analysis is typically applied. The focus will be on practical application of concepts through examples.

##### Meta-Analysis: An Introduction 
This workshop provides research students with a theoretical and practical introduction to meta-analysis as part of a systematic review. In this workshop we will be examining the process of performing a meta-analysis, in particular focusing on key statistical concepts such as heterogeneity and Fixed and Random effects modelling. The available choices of statistical software will be discussed, and you will be shown worked examples using the metafor package in R. A basic knowledge of R software is desirable, but not necessary, since you are not expected to produce and run your own code during the workshop.

##### Introduction to Survival Analysis 
Survival analysis is used when you want to measure the time elapsed up to when a specified event occurs. It is commonly used in studies where subjects are followed until death occurs, hence the name. In this workshop we will introduce some key concepts pertaining to survival analysis, including censoring of cases, the survival function, and the hazard ratio estimator. The Kaplan Meier survival curve will be explained through a worked example and the technique of Cox proportional hazards regression will be introduced using the same example dataset. You will be provided with software code in SPSS and R to reproduce the analysis presented in the workshop.
