[**Teacup Giraffes**](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/01_introToR.html)

*Alex says: A visual, storytelling and R coding-driven approach to introducing basic statistical concepts.*

[**Seeing Theory**](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)

*Alex says: Beautiful interactive animations that illustrate important concepts in probability and statistical theory.*

[**Measures of Association**](https://shiny.vet.unimelb.edu.au/epi/2x2/)

*Kathrin says: This resource from the University of Melbourne nicely illustrates the calculation and interpretation for measures of associations in observational studies using animation. A good understanding of measures such as odds ratio (OR) and risk ratio (RR) is required for many different analyses, including logistic regression and meta-analysis.*
