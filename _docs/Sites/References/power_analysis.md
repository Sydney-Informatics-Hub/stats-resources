**Julious, S. A. Sample Size for Clinical Trials** [**@USyd library**](https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/14vvljs/alma991000960739705106)

*Jim says: Clinical trials often involve testing variations on the classic hypothesis of a difference between groups.  The research question in a clinical trial might require a test of “equivalence”, “superiority” or “non-inferiority”, for example.  This book by Julious sets out how to handle each option, including useful worked examples.*
