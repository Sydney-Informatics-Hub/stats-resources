### University Provided Software
R, Rstudio and Python are freeware which can be downloaded from the web. For a list of other software the university provides access to refer to the article "What software is available to University staff?" on the services portal [**requesting project help**](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011594) (article KB0011594). At the time of writing this included SPSS, AMOS, GenStat, SAS, Mathematica, MATLAB, ArcGIS.

### R and RStudio

**[Learning the R Tidyverse](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-r-tidyverse/)**

*Kathrin says: This LinkedIn Learning course is a great introductory resource to learn R software coding for statistical analysis. The "tidyverse" is a collection of some of the most versatile R packages for cleaning, processing, modelling, and visualising your data. The course is free with a University of Sydney login.*

**[R Ladies Sydney: RYouWithMe?](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/)**

*Ali says: This R Ladies Sydney course is a great way to learn the basics of R and tidyverse. It actually helped me learn how to use the tidyverse during my Postdoc in Biostats. It walks you through a range of R packages and functions for data cleaning, visualisation, and presentation, by providing you with easy-to-follow videos, lesson outcomes and tasks, and step-by-step instructions for carrying out these tasks with a sample dataset.*


### SPSS

**[SPSS Statistics Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spss-statistics-essential-training-2)**

*Jim says: This LinkedIn Learning course is an ideal way to introduce yourself to the SPSS environment and learn everything from the basics of data manipulation and visualisation right through to linear and logistic regression. Having access to exercise files, speaker transcripts and captions, Q&A and your own notebook make it really accessible and user friendly. You’ll be browsing the other content on LinkedIn Learning after you have finished this one.  The course is free with a University of Sydney login.*

**McCormick, K. et al. SPSS Statistics for Data Analysis and Visualization** [**@USyd library**](https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/14vvljs/alma991031521458605106)

*Jim says: There are many textbooks on SPSS that cover the basics in detail (my favourite is the one by Andy Field), but not many that cover the more advanced features of SPSS. So once you have learnt the basics, this is a great reference to learn more about advanced statistics, data visualisation, predictive analytics and advanced programming techniques.*

**SPSS Contextual Help**

*Jim says: When you open a dialog box for an analysis and you are faced with a variety of options that seem to be written in a foreign language, click on the help button to see the details. It is actually quite helpful.  If that is not enough detail, go to the main menu “Help>Documentation in pdf format” and download the manuals.*

**[SPSS Coding Systems for Categorical Variables in Regression Analysis](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/spss/faq/coding-systems-for-categorical-variables-in-regression-analysis/#:~:text=Unlike%20dummy%20coding%2C%20effect%20coding,variable%20must%20sum%20to%20zero)**

*Chris says: This website is a great explainer for what the different contrasts mean and the comparisons they make when you run a linear model in SPSS. It discusses the different coding options for recoding categorical variables (e.g. dummy coding or effect coding). I was extremely excited to find this resource!*
